# ON THE LINE : An extension of my memory

'On The Line📸' *is a mobile service that automates line drawing.*

 On the Line started with LINIST's vision to provide an opportunity to make memories as easy and comfortable as anyone wants.
 You can convert photos into line drawing images in any style you want, and share them with your friends by posting them on your account.
